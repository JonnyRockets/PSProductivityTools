# Introduction

The PSProductivityTools PowerShell module contains commands for productivity tools & topics such as time management.

# Installation

The module is published to the PowerShell Gallery, which means you can install it using the following command from the PowerShellGet module:

`Install-Module -Name PSProductivityTools`

or the following if you want it installed the current users profile (*$env:userprofile\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*) rather than the system wide location (*$env:programfiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*):

`Install-Module -Name PSProductivityTools -Scope CurrentUser`

When a new version is released with bug fixes or new functionality you can update to the latest version simply by typing the following command:

`Update-Module -Name PSProductivityTools`

PowerShellGet is included by default in PowerShell V5, and available downlevel for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0.
